# BMA AI Content Automation

## Overview
This project is a SaaS platform that automates daily blog posting and content distribution for client businesses.  
The goal is to reduce manual content creation and publishing while maintaining brand-specific accuracy and SEO best practices.

## Core Features
- **Business Input Profile**: Each client provides detailed business context (e.g., services, niche, industry, values, keywords).
- **AI Content Generation**: The system uses GPT-based models to generate blog posts, social posts, and SEO-optimized content.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Content is created and published daily, 7 days a week.
- **WordPress Integration**: Posts are automatically published via a secure WordPress API plugin.
- **LinkedIn Integration**: Posts can also be automatically published to a clientâ€™s LinkedIn page.
- **SEO Optimization**: Generated posts should include metadata, titles, keywords, and formatting for maximum visibility.

## Tech Goals
- **Frontend/UI**: Dashboard where admins and clients can manage profiles, see scheduled posts, and review published content.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server that handles API calls, user authentication, and task scheduling.
- **Database**: Store client profiles, API keys, schedules, and generated content (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- **AI Pipeline**: Integrate with OpenAI (or another LLM API) for text generation.
- **Scheduler**: Automate daily content generation and publishing jobs (e.g., using cron jobs or a queue system).
- **Integrations**: WordPress REST API, LinkedIn API.

## Future Extensions
- Support for additional platforms (Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter).
- Content performance analytics and reporting.
- Multi-language support.
- Custom tone/style fine-tuning.

This repository will evolve into a SaaS platform where agencies (like BMA) can onboard multiple businesses and fully automate their content creation and publishing workflows.
